# Hide

Hides the pad or bar (this is a method of [SFPad](Class%20SFPad.md) and [SFBar](Class%20SFBar.md)).

This is normally used when, for context purposes, you want a pad or bar to be defined but not always visible. To display the pad or bar, call [Show](Show.md). You can also set the [lVisible](lVisible.md) property to .F. to hide the pad or .T. to show it.
